# chatRoomExercise
AJAX Exercise - simple chat room.

Can test it out by opening to tabs - http://yadayadacreative.com/CDA/talk/login.php. 

On one tab sign in as 'User1', password: 'Password' (I know, super secure!).

On the other tab sign in as 'User2', password: '123'.

Note - to submit messages, click the 'Submit' checkbox to allow to send messages by pressing 'Enter' on your keyboard.
